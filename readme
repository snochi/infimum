"infimum" is a LaTeX package which is best suited for taking math notes.

As its name suggests, infimum has minimalistic design that nevertheless produces the most clean notes.

To use infimum:
  1) download infimum.sty, solmathsym.sty and solphyssym.sty, and save them at ~/texmf/tex/latex/commonstuff/ ; and
  2) download few fonts, such as ITC Kabel Std, listed in infimum.sty.
  
Package "minimal" is a previous version of "infimum"; it is no longer in use.
